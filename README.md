# multi-category-chart

In many different scenarios, contents are single-categorized and multi-tagged, by which I mean there are multiple tags but one single (though may be hierarchical) category system, e.g., file systems, blogs, etc. However, sometimes contents can be categorized in different ways. For storage, one category system is OK; but for visualization, flexibly organizing the contents with different category views will be very handy.

This repo targets addressing such requests by creating interactive charts from formatted json input.
